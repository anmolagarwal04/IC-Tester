# IC-Tester

## User requirements
--------
Design a Microprocessor based Tester to test the logical functioning of the following chips:
1. 7400
2. 7408
3. 7432
4. 7486
5. 747266
The IC to be tested will be inserted in a 14 pin ZIF socket. The user places the IC in the ZIF socket, closes it â€“ then enters the IC No, followed by the enter key.
The IC number is to be entered via a keyboard.
The keyboard has keys 0-9, backspace, enter and test.
The IC No. is displayed on the 7-segment display.
The testing will start once the user presses the test key.
After Test the result PASS/FAIL must be displayed on the 7-segment display.

## Contents
-----
The ASM file contains a complete working code for the IC tester. The BIN file contains the code which is loaded onto the microprocessor. The DSN file contains the optimised solution for the IC Tester.
